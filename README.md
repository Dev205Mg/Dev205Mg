## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m YaÃ«l R.
I am a web developer specializing in **PHP/Laravel** and a web designer using **Adobe XD**.
I have a passion for creating attractive and functional user interfaces.
In addition to my web development skills,
I also have experience with the **C# language** and the **WPF framework**,
which allows me to create robust and intuitive **desktop applications**.
I am open to collaborating on projects related to web design and development,
as well as projects involving **C# and WPF**. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss exciting projects.
